//! Fully connected FSM example with zero boilerplate.
//!
//! This demonstrates:
//! - Zero boilerplate FSM with default "allow all transitions" behavior
//! - Just three derives: #[derive(EnumEvent, FSMTransition, FSMState)]
//! - No manual FSMTransition implementation needed
//! - Using fsm_observer! macro to register observers in the FSM hierarchy
//! - ALL transitions are allowed (fully connected state graph)
//!
//! Run with: cargo run --example fully_connected

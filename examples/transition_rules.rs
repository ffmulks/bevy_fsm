//! Transition rules example using the same `GameState` enum as fully_connected.rs.
//!
//! This demonstrates:
//! - Custom transition rules via manual `FSMTransition` implementation
//! - Blocking specific transitions in an otherwise connected graph
//! - Logging which transitions succeed or get rejected
//! - Using `fsm_observer!` to register enter observers
//!
//! Blocked transitions in this example:
//!   MainMenu -> Paused
//!   Playing -> MainMenu
//!   GameOver -> Playing
//!   GameOver -> Paused
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run --example transition_rules`
